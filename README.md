# Aaron Rust Advent Of Code 2023

Deciding to put my advent of code on GitHub to pad my contributions

I mostly will find a solution for the problem and then never touch it again fair warning


My goal this year is to work on writing generic code that will hopefully be reusable by the end of the advent challenge.
